    <h1>Don't Annoy Me...</h1>
    <em>Study this before interacting with me hoomans</em>

    <h3>Hoomans</h3>
    <p>With the grace of a gorilla, and the stealth of an elephant, humans are such pleasant company. I mean, thank you for alerting mice and other potential dinner of your enormous presence before my every hunt! What help you lot are; it's indescribable.</p>
    <p>Could you tell I was joking? Maybe because I am. Jokes are a waste of my time, but I must resort to such trivial things when dealing with useless beings. Did you know the humans residing in my abode love to stick their faces in rectangular glowing objects all day? I mean what a great way to spend time; it's not like there's hunting and grooming to be done!</p>
    <p>Now you may be wondering: what is decent behavior for a human? It's pretty self explanatory, but here's a little list I compiled.</p>
    <h4>Acceptable Traits:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Be quiet unless spoken to</li>
        <li>Groom yourself: I can't keep doing it for you (yes you jasmine!)</li>
        <li>Provide me with 3 quality meals a day</li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> disturb my beauty sleep</li>
        <li>Walk with feline grace and stealth</li>
        <li>Give me a massage at least 3 times a day</li>

    </ul>



    <h3>Horrendous Cusine</h3>
    <p>I am a queen. A dinner fit for a queen does not consist of cheap, artifical wet food. I deserve only the best of all brands from my hooman. If she brings another bland meal to my bowl, I will personally teach her a lesson! Without violence of course...</p>
    <p>Also, I hate veggies! Do not ever try sneaking them into my meals; my strong nose can smell it a mile away. Although, here are some foods that I do approve of.</p>
    <h4>Quality Cuisine's:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Purina Kibble</li>
        <li>Fancy Feast</li>
        <li>Boiled chicken</li>
        <li>Tuna snacks and tubes</li>
        <li>Catnip and treats of course!</li>
        

    </ul>

    <p>As you can see all my pet peeves are common knowledge: if you were unaware of this information, you must be lacking brain matter. Nonetheless, you have learned from my page, so all will be fine. Take my words into consideration if you'd prefer not to endure my wrath.</p>
